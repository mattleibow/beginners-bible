title: Lazarus Lives Again
bible: John 11:1–44
---

One day, Jesus received a message
from Mary and Martha.
“Jesus, please come quickly.
Lazarus is very sick.” But Jesus stayed
where he was for two more days.

---

Then Jesus traveled to the place
where Mary and Martha lived.
Martha went to meet him.
She was crying.

---

Martha said to Jesus, “My dear brother
has died. If you had been here,
you could have healed him.”
Jesus was sad. He cried too.

---

Then Jesus walked over to Lazarus’s tomb.
He told some men to roll away the stone.
Jesus prayed out loud, “Father, I know you
always hear me. Now, show everyone that
you have sent me.”

---

Then Jesus shouted, “Lazarus, come out!”
Lazarus walked out of the tomb. He was
alive again! Everyone was amazed.
Many people believed in Jesus that day.
