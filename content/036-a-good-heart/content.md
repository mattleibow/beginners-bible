title: A Good Heart
bible: 1 Samuel 15:1–16:13
---

Saul was a good king for about 20
years. Then he began to disobey God.
God was sorry he made Saul the king.
Samuel was sad about it too.

---

God sent Samuel to a man named
Jesse to find a new king.
When Samuel met Jesse, he said,
“I would like to meet your sons.”

---

When Samuel saw them, he thought,
These are strong-looking men.

God said, “I do not look at the
outside of a person. I look at the inside
of a person. I look at the heart.”

---

Samuel asked Jesse,
“Do you have another son?”
Jesse said, “Yes. His name is David.
He is out in the field with the sheep.”
Samuel asked to see him.

---

As soon as David arrived,
God told Samuel, “He is the one
I want to be the next king.”
Samuelanointed
David. He poured
oil on David’s head, and David
was filled with God’s power.
