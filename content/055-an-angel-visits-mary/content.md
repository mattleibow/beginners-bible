title: An Angel Visits Mary
bible: Luke 1:26–38
---

God sent the angel Gabriel to visit
a young woman. Her name was Mary.
She was scared. She had never seen
an angel before.

---

Gabriel said, “Don’t be afraid. You are
very special to God. You will become
pregnant and give birth to a son.
You must name him Jesus.
He will be called the Son of the
Most High God.”

---

Mary asked, “How can it be so?
I am not married.”

---

Gabriel answered, “With God,
all things are possible.”

---

Mary said, “I love God. I will do
what he has chosen me to do.”
