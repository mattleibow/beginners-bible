title: Ten Lepers
bible: Luke 17:11–19
---

As Jesus was traveling, he met ten lepers.
Their bodies were covered with sores.
The lepers shouted,
“Jesus, please heal us!”

---

Jesus said, “Go. Show yourselves
to the priests.” The ten lepers left.
While they were walking away,
something amazing happened.

---

All ten of them were healed! Only
one man went back to thank Jesus.

---

He threw himself at Jesus’ feet
and said, “Thank you!”
Jesus wondered where the other
men were. They did not come
back to thank him.
