In the beginning, the world was empty.
Darkness was everywhere.
But God had a plan.

---

God separated the light from darkness.
"Let there be light!" He said.
And the light turned on.
He called the light "day."
And He called the darkness "night."
This was the end of the very first day.

---

The God said, "I will divide the waters."
He separated the waters into the clouds
above from the waters in the ocean below.
He called the space between them "sky."
This was the end of the second day.

---

Next, God rolled back the waters.
and some dry ground appeared.
He made plants of many shapes and colors.
He made mountains, hills and valleys.
This was the end of the third day.

---

God put a shining sun in
the sky for daytime.
He put a glowing moon and twinkling
stars in the sky for nighttime.
This was the end of the fourth day.

---

On the fifth day,
God made swishy fish and
squiggly creatures to live in the ocean.
Then God made birds
to fly across the sky.

---

On the sixth day, God made animals
to creep, crawl, hop, and gallop.
Then from the dust, God made the most
wonderful creature of all - a person.
God named him Adam.
On the seventh day, God rested.
