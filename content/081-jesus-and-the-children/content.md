title: Jesus and the Children
bible: Matthew 19:13–15; Mark 10:13–16; Luke 18:15–17

The children loved to spend time
with Jesus.

---

But the disciples didn’t understand.
They said, “Stop. Do not bother Jesus.
He is just too busy.”

Jesus told the disciples, “Let the children
come to me. Do not keep them away.
You must become like these little children
if you want to enter God’s kingdom.”

Then Jesus blessed the children.
