title: Jacob’s Dream
bible: Genesis 28
---

Jacob traveled for many miles.
His uncle Laban lived far away.
One night, he lay on the ground,
using a stone for his pillow.
Jacob fell fast asleep.

---

Jacob dreamed of a stairway to heaven.
Angels walked up and down.
God said, “I am watching over you,
Jacob. Someday, all of this land
will belong to you and your family.”

---

The next morning, when Jacob woke up,
he said, “The LORD
is in this place!”
He took his stone pillow and set it
up as a reminder of his dream.
Jacob praised God.
Then he continued on his way.
