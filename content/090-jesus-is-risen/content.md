title: Jesus Is Risen!
bible: Matthew 28:1–10; Mark 16:1–10; Luke 24:1–11; John 20:1–18
---

After Jesus died, some of his
friends laid his body in a big tomb.
They sealed it shut with a large round
stone. Soldiers guarded the tomb.

---

Three days later, the earth shook. An angel
of the Lord came down from heaven and
pushed the stone away from the tomb.
Then the angel sat on the stone.

---

When the soldiers saw the angel,
they fell to the ground.

---

Mary was walking to the tomb with some
of her friends. They saw the angel, who
said, “Do not be afraid. Jesus is not here.
He has risen!”

---

“Go and tell Peter and the other disciples
that Jesus is alive!”

---

On their way, the women saw Jesus.
They fell to their knees and worshiped
him. Jesus smiled and said, “Go tell the
others that I will see them in Galilee.”
So Mary ran to tell the disciples.
