title: Joseph’s Colorful Robe
bible: Genesis 37
---

Joseph was one of Jacob’s twelve sons.
Jacob loved him more than
all of his other sons.

---

Jacob made Joseph a colorful robe.
His brothers were jealous.
They wanted nice robes too.
And they wanted to be loved
as much as Joseph was loved.

---

Joseph had a dream. He told his family,
“We were bundling grain from the field.
Your bundles of grain bowed
down to mine.”

---

Then Joseph had another dream.
He said, “This time, the sun and moon and
eleven stars were bowing down to me.”
His father asked, “Does this mean our
family will bow down to you someday?”

---

The brothers were even more angry.
They threw Joseph into a dry well.

---

Along came some traders.
The brothers sold Joseph
to them as a slave.

---

They lied to their father and said
Joseph had been killed by a wild animal.
But God was with Joseph.
