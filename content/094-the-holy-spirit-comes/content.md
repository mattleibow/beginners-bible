title: The Holy Spirit Comes
bible: Acts 2
---

Thousands of people went to Jerusalem
to celebrate a Jewish holiday called
Pentecost
. They came from many
countries and spoke many different
languages. Jesus’ disciples were staying
there. They were praying together.

---

Suddenly, a noise filled the room.
It sounded like a strong wind blowing.
TheHoly Spirit
appeared as
tongues of fire on each of them.

---

They started talking in languages
they did not know.
The people in Jerusalem heard the noise
and came to see what was happening.

---

The crowd was amazed and asked,
“How are you able to speakour

languages?” Peter said, “The prophets
told us this would happen.”

---

Then Peter told them about God’s plan.
“God sent Jesus to save everyone
from the bad things we have done.”

---

The people asked, “What should we do?”
Peter replied, “Ask Jesus to forgive you
for your sins and be baptized in the
name of Jesus Christ.”

---

On that day, 3,000 people believed in
Jesus. The disciples baptized all of them.
