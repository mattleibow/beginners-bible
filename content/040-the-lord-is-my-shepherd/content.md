title: The LORD Is My Shepherd
bible: Psalm 23
---

This is one of King David’s songs
about God:
The LORD
is my shepherd.
He gives me everything I need.
He lets me lie down in fields of green
grass. He leads me beside quiet waters.
He gives me new strength.

---

He guides me in the right paths
for the honor of his name.
Even though I walk through the
darkest valley, I will not be afraid.
You, God, are with me. Your
shepherd’s rod and staff comfort me.

---

You prepare a feast for me
right in front of my enemies.
You pour oil on my head.
My cup runs over.

---

I am sure that your goodness
and love will follow me
all the days of my life.
And I will live in the house
of the LORD
forever.
