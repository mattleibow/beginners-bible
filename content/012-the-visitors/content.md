title: The Visitors
bible: Genesis 18; 21
---

One hot day, Abraham was resting
near his tent. He heard footsteps.

---

Three men were standing nearby.
Abraham went out to greet them.
“Would you like to rest in the shade?
We have plenty of cool water to drink.
Can I get you something to eat?”

---

Abraham told Sarah about the visitors.
He asked her to make a tasty meal.

---

While they were eating,
the three visitors shared some
exciting news. They said,
“Your wife is going to have a son.”

---

Sarah heard what they said.
She laughed, thinking,I am too old
.
God asked Abraham,
“Why did Sarah laugh?
Anything is possible with the LORD
.”

---

Sure enough, the next year,
Sarah had a baby boy.
They named him Isaac.
