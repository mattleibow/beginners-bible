title: Twelve Spies
bible: Numbers 13
---

Finally, the Israelites arrived near the
promised land. God told Moses to send
spies there. Moses picked 12 men.
He told them, “Find out what the
people are like. See if the land is good.”

---

The spies returned and said,
“The land is beautiful.
It is filled with plenty of food!
But the people there are big and strong!”

---

Joshua and Caleb said, “Do not worry.
God has promised us this land.
He will give it to us.”

---

The rest of the Israelites did not
agree with Joshua and Caleb.
Then God said to Moses,
“The people do not have faith in me.
They cannot enter the land.”
So for the next 40 years,
God’s people wandered in the desert.
