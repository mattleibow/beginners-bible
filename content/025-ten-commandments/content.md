God led the Israelites to a mountain.
Thunder roared and lightning flashed.
The people heard a loud trumpet blast.

God wrote the Ten Commandments on
two stone tablets for all his people to obey.

The Israelites needed a place
to worship. God showed them
exactly how to build a special tent.
It was called atabernacle
.
God placed a cloud over the tent.
Whenever the cloud moved,
the Israelites packed up and followed it.
