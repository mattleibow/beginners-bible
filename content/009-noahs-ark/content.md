title: Noah’s Ark
bible: Genesis 6–9
---

After Adam and Eve left the garden,
many people were born.
The people kept doing bad things,
and they forgot about God.

---

Except Noah. Noah loved God.

---

God was sad that everyone but Noah
forgot about him.
He told Noah about his plan to start over.
“Make yourself an ark,” God said.
“Here’s how.” So Noah and his family
began working on the ark.

---

When it was done, God said,
“Take your family and two of
every animal into the ark.”
Animals creeped, crawled, hopped,
and galloped onto Noah’s new boat.

---

After everyone was inside,
the rain began to fall.
And fall. And fall.
The ark rocked this way and
that way on the rising water.

---

Finally, the rain stopped.
Water covered everything!
Everyone inside the ark was safe.
Noah and his family were very happy.

---

One day, Noah sent a dove to find land.
It flew and flew but never found any.
So it came back. One week later,
Noah sent the dove out again.
This time it brought him an olive leaf.
Noah cheered, “It must have found land!”

---

The ark finally came to rest on
the top of a mountain.
God told Noah to leave the ark.
Noah and his family praised God.
God put a beautiful rainbow in the sky.
It was a sign of his promise to
never flood the whole earth again.
