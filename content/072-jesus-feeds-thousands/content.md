title: Jesus Feeds Thousands
bible: Matthew 14:13–22; Mark 6:30–44; Luke 9:10–17; John 6:1–15
---

Jesus and his disciples were tired.
They needed a quiet place to rest.
So they got into a boat and pushed off
from shore. A crowd followed the boat.

---

Over 5,000 people had come to see Jesus.
Even though he was tired,
Jesus wanted to help them. He
climbed out of the boat, and he
began to bless and heal many people.

---

Later that day, the disciples said to Jesus,
“It is getting late. These people should
go home and eat dinner.”

---

Jesus replied, “We can feed them.
See if anyone has any food to share.”

---

The disciples found one boy. He had
five loaves of bread and two small fish.
Jesus said, “Bring the boy to me.”

---

The disciples asked, “How will so little
food feed this many people?”
Jesus said, “You will see. Have the
people sit down.” Then Jesus took
the bread and gave thanks to God.

---

His disciples gave bread and fish
to everyone. To their surprise,
twelve baskets were left over!
