title: Chariot of Fire
bible: 1 Kings 19:19–21; 2 Kings 2:1–13
---

A man named Elisha was plowing
the field. God chose Elisha to be
Elijah’s helper.

---

Over the years, they traveled together.
They told many people about God’s love.

---

One day, they stopped beside a river.

---

Elijah took off his coat and struck
the water with it. The river opened up!
They walked across on a dry path.

---

Elijah was getting older. God was
preparing to take him to heaven.
Elijah asked Elisha if there was
anything he wanted. Elisha answered,
“I want a double portion of the spirit
God has given you.”

---

Suddenly a fiery chariot pulled by fiery
horses came down from the sky.
It separated the two of them, and Elijah
went up to heaven in a whirlwind to be
with God. Elijah’s coat fell to the ground.
Elisha picked it up. He struck the water
with it, and the water parted. Then Elisha
knew God had granted his request.
