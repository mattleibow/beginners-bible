title: Jesus Returns
bible: John 20:19–20
---

The disciples had locked themselves in a
small room because they were afraid the
leaders would send soldiers to arrest them.

---

Suddenly, Jesus appeared to them!
He said, “Peace be with you.”
They thought he was a ghost. But Jesus
said, “Touch my hands and my feet
so that you will know it is really me.”

---

The disciples cheered! They were
very, very happy to see Jesus again.
