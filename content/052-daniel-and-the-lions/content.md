title: Daniel and the Lions
bible: Daniel 6
---

Darius became the new king of Babylon.
Daniel was his chief helper. The king’s
other helpers did not like Daniel.

---

They said to the king, “You are such
a wonderful king. You should make a
new law that for the next 30 days,
everyone must pray only to you.
If they disobey, they will be thrown
into the lions’ den.”

---

King Darius made the new law, but
Daniel kept praying to God because
Daniel loved God. The king’s helpers
caught him praying.

---

They told King Darius, “Now you must
throw Daniel into the lions’ den.”
The king knew he had been tricked,
but he had to obey his new law.

---

Daniel was thrown into the lions’den.
He was not afraid. He knew God would
take care of him. King Darius told Daniel,
“I hope your God will save you.”
That night, the king could not sleep.
He was too worried about Daniel.

---

At sunrise, the king hurried to the lions’
den. “Has your God saved you from the
lions?” he called. “Yes!” answered Daniel.
“My God sent his angel to protect me.”
So Daniel returned to the palace. Then
King Darius ordered everyone to honor and
respect God.
