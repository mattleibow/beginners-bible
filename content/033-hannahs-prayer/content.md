title: Hannah’s Prayer
bible: 1 Samuel 1:1–20
---

Hannah loved God. She wanted to
have a baby, but she wasn’t able
to have any children.

---

Hannah and her husband went
to the tabernacle. She prayed to God,
“If you will give me a baby boy,
I will see that he serves you all his life.”

---

Eli was a priest. He saw Hannah praying.
She explained, “I am crying out to the
LORD
because I want him to answer
my prayer.” Eli gently told her,
“Go in peace—and may God give
you what you ask for.”

---

Sure enough, Hannah and her
husband had a baby boy.
They thanked God for their new son.
They named him Samuel.
