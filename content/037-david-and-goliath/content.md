title: David and Goliath
bible: 1 Samuel 17:1–51
---

The Philistines were enemies of God.
Their army came to fight King Saul’s army.
A giant soldier named Goliath yelled,
“Bring out your best soldier to fight me!”

---

“If your strongest soldier defeats me,
we will be your slaves!” he boomed.
“If I defeat him, you will be our slaves!”
King Saul’s soldiers were afraid.
They did not want to fight the giant.

---

Meanwhile, young David was taking
food to his brothers. They were
soldiers in King Saul’s army.
When David reached the camp,
he saw Goliath.
David heard the giant’s challenge.

---

“I am not afraid to fight the giant,”
said David. King Saul called for
David and told him, “You cannot fight
the giant. You are too young.”
David replied, “God will be with me.”

---

King Saul gave hisarmor
to David,
but it was big and heavy.
David wasn’t used to wearing armor.

---

David went to a nearby stream
and picked up five stones.
He stood before Goliath.
The giant laughed at him, but
David didn’t care. He said,
“I come before you in the name
of the LORD
who rules over all.”

---

David put a stone in his sling
and ran toward the giant.
Then he let the stone fly.

---

It hit Goliath’s forehead,
and he fell to the ground!
The Philistines saw that their hero
was dead. They ran away.
