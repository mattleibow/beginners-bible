title: Jonah and the Big Fish
bible: Jonah 1:1–3:10
---

Jonah was a prophet of God.
One day, God told Jonah,
“Go to the big city of Nineveh.
Tell them to stop doing bad things.”

---

But Jonah ran away. He did not want
to go to Nineveh. Instead he got on
a boat to sail across the sea.
God sent a big storm to stop Jonah.
The sailors on the boat were afraid.
They thought the boat was going to sink!

---

Jonah told the sailors,
“My God has sent this storm.
If you throw me into the water,
the sea will become calm again.”

---

So the sailors threw Jonah
into the raging sea.
Instantly, the sea became calm.

---

Just then, Jonah saw a big fish coming!
Gulp! The fish swallowed Jonah.

---

For three days and nights, Jonah was
inside the fish. He prayed to God,
“Please forgive me.”

---

Then God told the fish to spit Jonah onto
dry land. God told Jonah a second time,
“Go and tell the people of Nineveh
to stop doing bad things.”

---

This time, Jonah obeyed God.
The people in Nineveh
were sorry for doing bad things,
so God forgave them.
