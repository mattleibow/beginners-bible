title: Jars of Oil
bible: 2 Kings 4:1–7
---

Elisha helped many people.
One day, he met a woman.
She was very upset. She said,
“Please help me. I owe a man
some money.”

---

“If I do not pay him,” the woman said,
“he will make my sons become his
slaves!” Elisha asked her,
“Do you own anything?”
She said, “I have a little oil.”

---

Elisha said, “Gather some empty jars
from your friends. Then go inside
and pour your oil into them.”
The woman obeyed, and God made
her tiny bit of oil fill all the jars!

---

She sold all the oil and paid the man back.
She took care of her family with the
leftover money.
