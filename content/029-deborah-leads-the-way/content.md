title: Deborah Leads the Way
bible: Judges 4
---

The Israelites lived in the
promised land for many years.
But they forgot about God.
A bad king from another land
ruled over them.
The Israelites asked God for help.

---

God sent them a judge named Deborah.
She loved God very much.
God gave her a plan to defeat the bad
king. She sent for a man named Barak
and told him, “God wants you to take
10,000 soldiers and wait on the hill.”

---

The Israelites were not as
strong as their enemies.
Barak begged Deborah to go with them.
She was a strong leader. She agreed.

---

When the Israelites met face to face
with the king’s army, Deborah exclaimed,
“Go! Attack them now! God is with us!”
The Israelites obeyed and won the battle.
