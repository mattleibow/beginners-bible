title: Jacob and Esau Meet Again
bible: Genesis 29
---

While Jacob lived with his uncle Laban,
he became a shepherd.
He fell in love and got married.

---

God blessed Jacob with many sons.
Jacob also had many sheep,
donkeys, and camels.
One day, God told Jacob to
go back to his homeland.

---

Jacob wanted to go back,
but he was afraid of his brother, Esau.
He thought Esau would still be
angry with him.

---

But Jacob obeyed God.
He and his family packed up
everything they owned.
Jacob sent servants ahead
to offer gifts to Esau.

---

Much to Jacobâ€™s surprise,
Esau ran to meet him.
And he gave Jacob a big hug.
They were so happy
to see each other again.
