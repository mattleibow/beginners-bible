title: A Captain’s Faith
bible: Matthew 8:5–13
---

Jesus came down the mountain
to a nearby city.
Crowds of people gathered to see him.

---

An army captain said, “Lord Jesus,
my servant is very sick. Please,
will you help him?” Jesus said,
“I will go to your house and heal him.”

---

The captain replied, “You do not need
to go to my house. Just say the word
and my servant will be healed.”

---

Jesus was amazed. “I have not found
anyone whosefaith
is so strong,” he said.
Then Jesus said to the captain, “Go!
Your servant is healed.”
The captain ran home. He was happy
to see his servant well again!
