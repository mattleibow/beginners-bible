title: God Watches Over Elijah
bible: 1 Kings 16:29–17:7
---

After Solomon, many other kings ruled
over Israel. One king was named Ahab.
He did not love God.
King Ahab worshiped idols.

---

God had a prophet named Elijah.
God gave Elijah special messages
to tell the people.

---

Elijah told King Ahab, “God is angry
with you because you do not serve him.”

---

Then Elijah told the king,
“It will not rain for a very long time.
The crops will dry up, and
your people will go hungry.”
King Ahab was very angry with Elijah.

---

God told Elijah to escape to the desert.
He led Elijah to a brook. Each day,
Elijah drank from it, and each day,
God sent birds with food.
Elijah stayed there until the brook dried up.
