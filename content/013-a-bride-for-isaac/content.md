title: A Bride for Isaac
bible: Genesis 24–25
---

When Isaac grew up, his father,
Abraham, wanted him to get married.
Abraham told one of his servants,
“Go to my homeland. There you will find
the perfect bride for Isaac.”

---

So Abraham sent the servant
on his way with ten camels and
a lot of jewelry and clothes.
They were gifts for Isaac’s new bride.

---

The servant reached Abraham’s homeland.
He stopped by a well and prayed,
“Dear God, please show me the woman
you have chosen for Isaac.
I will know she is the one if she offers
water to me and my camels.”

---

Before he finished praying, a young
woman with a jar walked toward the well.
After she filled her jar, the servant asked
her for a drink. She gave him a drink.
Then she gave water to his camels.
She was the answer to his prayer!
Her name was Rebekah.

---

The servant gave her the gifts,
and they went to meet her father.
The servant asked for his permission
to take Rebekah to Isaac.
Rebekah told the servant she
would be happy to go.

---

When Isaac saw Rebekah,
he fell in love with her.
Soon, they got married.
Isaac and Rebekah had twin boys
named Esau and Jacob.
