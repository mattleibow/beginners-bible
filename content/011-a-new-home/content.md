title: A New Home
bible: Genesis 12–17
---

Abraham loved God.
So did his wife Sarah.

---

One day, God told Abraham
to move to a new land.
So, along with their helpers,
Abraham and Sarah packed up
and went.

---

Abraham’s nephew was Lot.
Lot and all his helpers
went with them too.

---

The helpers began to fight.
There was not enough grass
for all the animals.
So Abraham said to Lot,
“You pick your own land to live on.”

---

Lot chose the best land.
It had the most green grass
and the most water for his animals.
Lot moved to his new home.

---

Then God gave Abraham a blessing.
God said, “All the land you see here
will be yours forever. Also, you
and Sarah will be blessed
with many children.”

---

God led Abraham and Sarah
to a place called Hebron.
It was beautiful.
