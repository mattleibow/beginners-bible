title: A Net Full of Fish
bible: John 21:1–14
---

Peter went fishing with some of the
disciples. They fished from their
boat all night, but they did not
even catch one fish.

---

Early the next morning, someone from
the shore shouted, “You have not caught
any fish, have you?”
“No,” they replied. “Cast your net to the
right side of the boat,” the man said.

---

As soon as they did, their net was
full of fish! Then Peter knew the man
was Jesus. He jumped out of the boat
and swam to shore.

---

Jesus asked him, “Do you love me?”
Peter said, “You know I do.”
Jesus said, “If you love me, then
take good care of my people.”
