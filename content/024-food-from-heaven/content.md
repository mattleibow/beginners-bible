title: Food From Heaven
bible: Exodus 16
---

The Israelites traveled for many days.
They were tired and hungry.
They complained to Moses,
“There is nothing to eat in the desert.
At least we had food in Egypt!
Now we are starving!”

---

God heard them. That evening,
God sent birds calledquail
for the
Israelites to eat.

---

The next morning, God sent
bread from heaven. It was called
manna
and tasted like honey.
The Israelites found the manna
on the ground.
But they complained again:
“We are thirsty!”

---

Moses asked God what to do. God said,
“Hit the rock with your staff.”
When Moses hit it, cool, fresh water
gushed out for everyone to drink.
While they were in the desert,
the Israelites would not go hungry
or thirsty again.
