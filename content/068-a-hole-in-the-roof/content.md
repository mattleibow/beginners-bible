title: A Hole in the Roof
bible: Matthew 9:1–8; Mark 2:1–12; Luke 5:17–26
---

Jesus was at a house preaching.
Many people gathered there because
they heard he was healing the sick.

---

The house was overflowing with people.
Many had to stand outside. There was no
room left, not even outside the door.

---

Down the road lived a man who
could not walk. He was paralyzed.
His friends believed Jesus could heal him.

---

They carried him to the house.
It was still too crowded.
So they carried him up to the roof.

---

The man’s friends made a hole and
lowered him down to Jesus.
Jesus saw that the men had faith.
He knew how much they loved
their friend.

---

Jesus said to the man,
“Your sins are forgiven.”
The man stood up and walked!
The crowd praised God.
