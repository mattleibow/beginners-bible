title: Shepherds Visit
bible: Luke 2:8–20
---

On the night Jesus was born,
shepherds were watching their sheep.
Suddenly, an angel stood before them,
and God’s light shined all around.

---

The angel said, “Do not be afraid. I bring
joyful news to all people. Today, in the
town of Bethlehem, aSavior
has been
born! He is lying in a manger.”

---

Then a choir of angels appeared.
They sang, “Glory to God in the highest!
Peace and goodwill to everyone on earth!”

---

The shepherds rushed to Bethlehem.
There they found baby Jesus.
They told Mary and Joseph
what the angel said.

---

As they returned to their sheep,
the shepherds told everyone what they
had seen and heard. All along the way,
the shepherds shouted praises to God.
