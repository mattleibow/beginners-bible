title: Jesus Teaches on a Mountain
bible: Matthew 5:1–12; 6:25–34; Luke 6:17–23; 12:22–31

All sorts of people went to see Jesus.
Children, mothers, fathers,
grandmas, and grandpas.
They all wanted to hear what
he was teaching.

---

“Look at the birds,” said Jesus.
“Do they store up food in a barn?
No. God feeds them.”

---

“Look at the flowers,” said Jesus.
“They don’t work or make clothes.
God dresses them in lush leaves
and pretty petals.”

---

Then Jesus said, “You are much more
important than birds. You are much
more important than flowers.
So do not worry. If God takes care
of them, God will take care of you.”
