Adam loved his new home.
His job was to name all the animals
and care for the garden.
Adam loved all the animals,
but he could not find a friend
that was just right for him.
So God created a woman.

Adam named her Eve.
She was just right for Adam.
Adam and Eve loved each other.
Together they took care
of Godâ€™s garden.
