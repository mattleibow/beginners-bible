title: Jesus Is Arrested and Crucified
bible: Matthew 26–27; Mark 14–15; Luke 22–23; John 18–19
---

Judas went to the leaders. He asked,
“How much will you pay me if I help
you capture Jesus?” They said,
“Thirty pieces of silver.” So Judas took
the money and made a plan.

---

Jesus had gone to his favorite garden
to pray. The disciples went along.
Jesus prayed, “Father, if it is your will,
I am ready to give my life so that
all the people who trust in me will be
saved from their sins.”

---

Soon, Judas arrived with some soldiers.
Peter wanted to protect Jesus.
But Jesus said, “No. I must allow this
to happen.” All the disciples ran away,
and the soldiers arrested Jesus.

---

They took Jesus to the leaders.
The leaders said, “You say that
you are the Son of God.
We do not believe you.”

---

The soldiers took charge of Jesus.
They made him carry a big wooden cross.
They took him to a place called
The Skull (Golgotha
).
There they nailed Jesus to the cross.

---

Jesus died on the cross.

---

Everyone who loved Jesus was very sad.
But they forgot something important. Jesus
had said he would see them again soon!
