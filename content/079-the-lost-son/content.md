title: The Lost Son
bible: Luke 15:11–32
---

Jesus told another parable about God’s
love. “There was a man who had two
sons,” said Jesus. “He owned a big farm.”

---

“His youngest son did not want to
work anymore. He wanted to travel
and have fun. So he asked his father
for his share of the family money.”

---

“The son got the money. He packed his
things and left. He couldn’t wait to see the
world! His family was sad to see him go.”

---

“At first he had fun spending the money.
He bought expensive clothes,
and he ate fancy food.
But soon all the money was gone.”

---

“He had to go to work and he got a job
with a pig farmer. He was so hungry that
even the pigs’ food looked good.
The son wanted to go back home.
He said, ‘I will tell my father
I am sorry for what I have done.
I do not deserve to be called his son.
Maybe he will let me work for him.’ ”

---

“The father saw his son coming
down the road. His eyes filled
with tears as he ran to greet him.”

---

“The son said, ‘Please forgive me, Dad.’
That night, they had a big party.
The father exclaimed, ‘My son
was lost, but now he’s found.’ ”

---

Jesus explained his story.
“God is like this father. He is full
of love and joy when people who
are lost come back to him.”
