title: Jesus Walks on Water
bible: Matthew 14:22–33; Mark 6:45–51; John 6:15–20
---

Jesus told his disciples to go
on ahead of him.

---

Then Jesus walked up a mountainside
to pray. Storm clouds filled the sky.
Jesus could see the disciples in the boat.
They were having trouble.

---

The wind swooshed. The waves sloshed.
The boat was tossed about.

---

Suddenly, the disciples saw someone
walking on the water toward them.
They thought it was a ghost!

---

Jesus called out to them,
“It is I. Do not be afraid!”
The disciples still weren’t sure.
Peter said, “If you really are Jesus,
let me walk out to you.”
Jesus replied, “Come!”

---

Peter stepped out of the boat. He began
walking on the water toward Jesus. Then
Peter looked at the wind and the waves.
He became afraid. Suddenly he started
to sink. “Lord, save me!” Peter cried out.
Jesus reached out and pulled Peter up.

---

“Why didn’t you trust me?” Jesus asked
Peter. They climbed into the boat and
the storm stopped. The disciples
worshiped Jesus. They said,
“Truly you are the son of God!”
