title: Jesus Calms the Storm
bible: Matthew 8:23–27
---

Jesus and his disciples got into a boat.
They wanted to cross the sea.

---

Jesus took a nap.
The waves gently rocked
the boat back and forth.

---

Suddenly a great storm came up.
Waves splashed over the boat.
Winds whipped around the disciples.

---

They woke Jesus up and shouted,
“The boat is sinking! Don’t you care?”

---

Jesus asked, “Why are you so afraid?
Don’t you have any faith at all?”
Then Jesus told the storm to stop.
Right away it was calm.

---

The disciples were amazed. They said
to each other, “Who is this man Jesus?
Even the wind and the waves obey him!”
