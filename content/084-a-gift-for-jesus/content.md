title: A Gift for Jesus
bible: John 12:1–8
---

One evening, Jesus and his disciples were
visiting Mary, Martha, and Lazarus.

---

Mary poured some expensive perfume
on Jesus’ feet. Then she dried his feet
with her hair.

---

Judas was one of the disciples. He said,
“That perfume cost a lot of money.
Mary should have sold it and given
the money to the poor.”

---

Jesus knew the truth—that Judas wanted the
money for himself. Jesus replied, “Mary did
what is right. She honored me.
You will always have the poor among you.
But you won’t always have me here.”
