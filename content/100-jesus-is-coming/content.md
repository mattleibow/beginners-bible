title: Jesus Is Coming!
bible: Revelation 1:1–2; 21:2–4
---

Many years later, the disciple John
lived on an island. While he was there,
an angel came to him in a vision.

---

In the vision, a bright light surrounded
Jesus. He spoke to John, “Do not be
afraid. Write a book about what you
see and send it to the churches.”

---

In the vision, John saw God sitting on
his throne. A rainbow sparkled all
around him. John saw that everything
bad on the earth had come to an end.

---

Then John saw a new heaven and a
new earth. God said, “There will be
no more death or sadness or crying or
pain. I will live with my people forever.”

---

Then Jesus promised,
“I am coming back soon.”
