title: Mary and Martha
bible: Luke 10:38–42
---

Mary, Martha, and their brother
Lazarus were friends with Jesus.

---

One day, Jesus came over to visit.
Mary sat at his feet and listened
to him for a long time.

---

Meanwhile, Martha was busy cooking and
cleaning. There was so much to do!

---

The longer Mary listened to Jesus,
the madder Martha got. She said,
“I am busy in the kitchen while
Mary is doing nothing!”

---

“Jesus, please tell my sister to help me,”
Martha whined.

---

“Martha, Martha,” said Jesus,
“You should not be upset.
Mary has chosen what is better.
She is listening to me.”
