title: A Voice in the Night
bible: 1 Samuel 3
---

When Samuel was a little boy, Hannah
brought him to live at the tabernacle.
She had promised God that Samuel
would serve him all his life. The
priest Eli would now take care of Samuel.
He would teach Samuel about God.

---

One night while Samuel was sleeping,
he heard a voice say, “Samuel!”
He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am.”
But Eli said, “I did not call you.”
Then Samuel went back to bed.

---

Samuel heard a voice call his
name two more times.
Each time, Samuel ran to Eli.
Finally, Eli told Samuel, “I think God
is speaking to you. Next time, say,
‘Yes, LORD
, I am listening.’ ”
Then Samuel went back to bed.

---

“Samuel! Samuel!” the voice said again.
This time, Samuel answered, “Yes, LORD
,
I am listening.” From that moment on,
Samuel gave messages to God’s people.
He was a special prophet of God.
