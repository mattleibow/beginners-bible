title: An Angry King
bible: Matthew 2:13–23
---

When the Wise Men did not return,
King Herod became very angry.

---

He yelled at his soldiers,
“Go and find the boy!
I will be theonly
king of the Jews!”

---

But God’s angel warned Joseph
in a dream, “Take your family and
escape to Egypt. Do not return
until I tell you it is safe.”

---

That night, Joseph and Mary left
for Egypt with baby Jesus.

---

Years later, God’s angel said to Joseph
in a dream, “King Herod is dead.
Now, it is safe to leave Egypt.”
So Joseph, Mary, and Jesus left Egypt and
went back home to Nazareth.
