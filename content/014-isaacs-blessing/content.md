title: Isaac’s Blessing
bible: Genesis 27
---

When Isaac was an old man,
he could not see very well.
He called for his firstborn son, Esau.
“Bring me my favorite dinner.
Then I will give you God’s blessing.”

---

“I will make a special meal
for you,” said Esau.
Then he hunted for some meat to cook.

---

Isaac’s wife Rebekah wanted
Jacob
to get God’s blessing.
So, while Esau was hunting,
she told Jacob her plan.
She made Isaac’s dinner.
Then she tied goatskins
around Jacob’s arms.

---

Jacob took the meal to his father.
After dinner, Isaac reached out
to bless his son.
Isaac thought Jacob was Esau.
So he gave Jacob his blessing.

---

When Esau returned,
he found out what had happened.
Esau was very angry.
He wanted to hurt Jacob.
Rebekah asked Isaac to send Jacob
to his uncle Laban’s house.
