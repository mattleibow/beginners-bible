Many trees grew in the Garden of Eden.
God told Adam and Eve, “You may eat
the fruit from any tree except for one.
Never eat the fruit from the tree
of the knowledge of good and evil.”

---

Now, there was a sneaky snake
in the garden.
One day, the snake saw Eve
near the special tree.
It hissed, “Did Godreally
tell you
not to eat the fruit from this tree?”

---

The snake wanted Eve to disobey God.
It said, “You should try some
of this tasty fruit.
If you eat it, you will be like God.
You will be able to tell the difference
between good and evil.”

---

The fruit looked tasty.
Eve remembered what God had said,
but she ate the fruit anyway.
Then Eve gave some to Adam.
He took a bite too.

---

As the sun was going down,
Adam and Eve heard God
walking through the garden.
He was looking for them.
Adam and Eve hid among the trees.
They were afraid.

---

“What have you done?” God asked.
“Did you eat the fruit from
the forbidden tree?”
Adam said, “Yes, but Eve gave it to me.”
Eve said, “Yes, but the snake tricked me.”

---

God told the snake, “Because of what you
did, you will always crawl on your belly.”
Then he told Adam and Eve,
“Because you disobeyed me,
you can no longer live in the garden.”

---

Adam and Eve left the garden.
God placed angels and a flaming sword
to guard the entrance.
Adam and Eve would not be allowed
in the garden again.
