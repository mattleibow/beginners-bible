title: The Lame Man
bible: Acts 3:1–10
---

One day, Peter and John were going
to the temple. They saw a man
who could not walk. He had not
been able to walk his whole life.
The man was begging for money.

---

Peter told him, “We have no silver or gold.
But we will give you what we do have.
In Jesus’ name, stand up and walk!”

---

Immediately, the man jumped up.
His legs were strong! He began
walking and leaping and praising God.

---

All the people who saw him were amazed.
Peter told the people, “We did not
make this man walk. Jesus did.” Many
more people believed in Jesus that day.
