title: Joshua and the Spies
bible: Joshua 2
---

After Moses died, Joshua became
the leader of the Israelites.
God led them into the promised land.
He led them to a city called Jericho.
The city was protected by high walls.

---

Still, two spies found a way into
the city. They went to Rahab’s house.
The king of Jericho ordered his
soldiers to capture the men.

---

Rahab hid the men on her roof.
When the soldiers arrived, she said,
“The spies have already gone.
If you hurry, you may catch them.”
So the soldiers ran off to find them.

---

“Thank you for helping us,” the spies
told her. “When we come back,
we promise to save you and your family.”
Then Rahab helped the spies escape.
