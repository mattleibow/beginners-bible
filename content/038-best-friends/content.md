title: Best Friends
bible: 1 Samuel 16:14–23; 18–20
---

King Saul became grumpy.
His servants asked David to play his harp
for the king. The music cheered him up,
so the king invited David to live in
the palace.

---

David became friends with
King Saul’s son, Prince Jonathan,
and Jonathan’s sister, Michal.

---

David won many battles for the king.
The people said David was a better
fighter than the king. This made King
Saul very angry and jealous.Everyone likes David more than me
, he thought.

---

King Saul became so angry that
he threw a spear at David,
but David escaped.

---

Then one day, Prince Jonathan warned
David, “You must run far away.”
They promised to always be best friends.
