title: The Red Sea
bible: Exodus 14
---

Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt.
During the day, God went ahead of them
in a pillar of cloud. During the night,
God went ahead of them in a pillar of fire.

---

God led the Israelites to the
edge of the Red Sea.
Pharaoh and his army were close behind.
The Israelites did not know what to do.

---

They screamed, “We are trapped!
What have you done to us, Moses?”
Moses said, “Do not be afraid.
God will protect us.” God’s cloud came
between the Israelites and Pharaoh’s army.
They could not see anything!

---

God told Moses, “Raise your staff
over the sea.” Then the Lord pushed
back the sea to make a path.
Moses and the Israelites followed the path
through the sea and to the other side.
But Pharaoh’s army followed close behind.

---

Moses raised his staff again, and
the sea swept away Pharaoh and his army.
Moses and all the Israelites sang praises
to God. They were free!
They weren’t slaves anymore!
