title: Jesus Heals a Blind Beggar
bible: John 9:1–12
---

Jesus and his disciples saw a blind beggar.
He had been blind since he was born.
The disciples asked Jesus, “Teacher,
did this man sin? Or did his parents?
Is that why he is blind?”

---

“No one sinned,” said Jesus. “This
happened so that God’s work could be
shown in his life.” Then Jesus spit on
the ground and made mud out of it
with his hands. He gently spread
the mud on the blind man’s eyes.

---

Then Jesus told the man,
“Go to the Pool of Siloam
and wash off the mud.”

---

As soon as the mud was washed off, the
man could see! Everyone was amazed.
They wanted to find out more about Jesus.
