title: The Tall Tower
bible: Genesis 11
---

After the flood, everyone spoke
the same language.
One word meant “hello.”
One word meant “Mom,”
and one word meant “Dad.”

---

The people said, “If we work together,
we can do anything.
Let’s build a tower that goes all
the way up to heaven.
Then everyone will see
how great we are!”

---

The people worked on their tower.
They built it taller and taller.
They began to brag.
God did not like the way
they were acting.
It was as if they no longer needed him.

---

So God mixed up their language.
When they tried to talk to each other,
it sounded like “babble.”
Everyone was confused!

---

Then God scattered the people
all over the earth.
They had to stop building their tower.
From then on, the tower
was called “Babel.”
