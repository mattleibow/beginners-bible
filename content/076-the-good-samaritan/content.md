title: The Good Samaritan
bible: Luke 10:25–37
---

One day, a lawyer put Jesus to the test.
He said, “I know the law says to love God
with all my heart and to love my neighbor
as myself. But who is my neighbor?”

---

Jesus told him this parable:
“A man was on his way to the city
of Jericho. Some robbers beat him.
They stole everything he had.”

---

“The man was hurt. He needed help. Along
came a priest. The priest saw the man, but
he did not stop. Along came a helper in the
temple. He saw the man but did not stop.
Along came a Samaritan man. When he saw
the hurt man, he stopped. The Samaritan
man cleaned up the man’s wounds.”

---

“He lifted the man onto his own donkey
and took him down the road to an inn.
They stayed at the inn. The Samaritan
man took care of the hurt man all night
long,” said Jesus.

---

“In the morning, the Samaritan man gave
the innkeeper two silver coins and said,
‘Take good care of him until I return.’ ”

---

After Jesus finished the story, he asked,
“Which one of the three men was the
neighbor?” The lawyer answered,
“The one who took care of the hurt man.”
Jesus said, “Go and do as he did.”
