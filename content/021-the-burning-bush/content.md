title: The Burning Bush
bible: Exodus 3
---

When Moses was a man,
he left the palace.
Pharaoh was still being mean
to the Israelites.
Moses tried to protect them,
so Pharaoh tried to kill Moses.

---

Moses escaped from Egypt.
He went to a place called Midian
and became a shepherd.

---

One day, while Moses was watching
his sheep, he saw something strange.
A bush was on fire, but it wasn’t
burning up. From inside the bush,
God spoke, “Moses, bring my
people out of Egypt. Take them
to a new land that I will show you.
This new land is called Canaan.”

---

Moses was worried that Pharaoh
would not listen. God told Moses
to throw his staff on the ground.
When he did, the staff became a snake!
God told Moses to reach down and grab
the snake. It became a staff again!
God said, “I will use signs like this
to show Pharaoh I have sent you.”

---

“But I cannot speak very well,”
complained Moses.
God said, “Do not worry.
Your brother Aaron is a good speaker.
I will send him with you.”

---

So Moses returned with Aaron to Egypt.
When they arrived, Moses told the
Israelites what God had said.
