title: The True King
bible: Matthew 21:1–11; Mark 11:1–11; Luke 19:29–42; John 12:12–19
---

Jesus and his disciples went to Jerusalem
for the Passover Feast. Jesus told
two disciples to bring him a donkey.
He told them where to find it.

---

Jesus rode the donkey to Jerusalem.

---

A big crowd welcomed him.

---

People waved palm branches and put them
on the road in front of Jesus.

---

They shouted, “Hosanna! Hosanna!
Blessed is the king of Israel!”

---

The leaders in Jerusalem did not
like Jesus. They saw how many people
were following him, and they were
angry about it. They were jealous.
