Then Jesus did something else.
He picked up a loaf of bread and blessed it.
Then he broke it into pieces.
He gave the bread to his disciples to eat.
Jesus said, “This bread is my body.
Every time you do this, think of me.”

In the same way, he took a cup of wine
and blessed it. He gave it to the disciples
to drink. “This is my blood. It is poured
out to forgive the sins of many.”

“The time has come for me to go away.
Where I am going, you cannot go yet.
I am going toheaven
to prepare a
wonderful new home for you.
But I will return to you soon.”

“At first, you will be very sad.
But do not be frightened.
Soon you will understand
and you will be filled with joy.”
