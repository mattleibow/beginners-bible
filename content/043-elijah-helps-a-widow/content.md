title: Elijah Helps a Widow
bible: 1 Kings 17:8–16
---

God told Elijah to go to a nearby town.
There he would find a woman who would
take care of him. When Elijah arrived,
he saw a widow gathering sticks.
He asked her for some water and bread.

---

The woman said, “My son and I
only have enough flour and oil
for one last meal.”
Elijah replied, “Don’t be afraid.
God will not let you go hungry.”

---

The woman poured him some water
and made him some bread.
Because she took care of Elijah, God
took care of her. The woman’s flour
and oil never ran out!
