title: Baby Jesus Is Born
bible: Luke 2:1–7
---

Mary loved Joseph. Mary and Joseph were
going to be married soon.
Joseph lived in Nazareth, but his
family lived in Bethlehem.

---

A new leader named Caesar ordered all
people to go back to their homeland.
He wanted to count all the people
in his kingdom. So Mary and Joseph
went to Bethlehem.

---

Mary was going to have her baby soon.
When they arrived in Bethlehem,
they looked for a safe place to sleep,
but all the inns were full.

---

Finally, a man was able to help them.
He said, “I do not have any rooms left,
but you are welcome to sleep
in the stable.”

---

Joseph made a warm place for Mary
to rest. While they were there,
little baby Jesus was born.

---

Mary wrapped Jesus in strips of cloth
and gently laid him in a manger.
