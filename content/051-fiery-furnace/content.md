title: Fiery Furnace
bible: Daniel 3
---

King Nebuchadnezzar’s army had defeated
the Israelites. Now he was their ruler.
King Nebuchadnezzar built a golden statue.
Then he made a bad law. It said,
“When the music plays, everyone must bow
down and worship the statue.
Those who disobey will be thrown
into the fiery furnace.”

---

The music began to play. The people
fell down and worshiped the statue. But
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
refused. “We only worship the true God,”
they said. The king was mad!

---

The king said, “Make the furnace
extra hot!” He had the three men thrown
inside. Yet, when the king looked
into the furnace, there were four men
walking around! One of them looked
like an angel from God.

---

The king shouted to the men,
“Come out! Your God has saved you!”
The fire had not hurt them. They did not
even smell like smoke! So the king made
them rulers in his kingdom.
