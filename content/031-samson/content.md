title: Samson
bible: Judges 13; 16
---

The Israelites were in trouble again.
Along came a very strong man
named Samson. God had chosen
him to save the Israelites from
their enemies, the Philistines.

---

Samson knew that as long as
he did not cut his hair,
he would always be very strong.

---

Samson was in love with Delilah.
The Philistines told Delilah they
would pay her if she found out
what made Samson so strong.
At first, Samson lied to her.

---

“If you tie me up with ropes,”
Samson said, “I will lose my strength.”
That night while Samson slept,
Delilah tied him up. Then she shouted,
“The Philistines are coming!”
Samson jumped up and broke the ropes.
Delilah kissed him and asked,
“Won’t you tell me your secret?”

---

Samson gave in and told her,
“My strength is in my long hair.”
When Samson was asleep,
Delilah had all his hair cut off.
Samson’s strength was gone!
The Philistines grabbed him
and put him in jail.

---

A while later, the Philistines were having
a big party. They brought Samson in
and made fun of him.
Samson prayed to God to make him
strong one last time. God did.
Samson pushed the pillars with all his
might. The temple came crashing down,
and Samson defeated the Philistines.
