title: Naaman Is Healed
bible: 2 Kings 5:1–15
---

Naaman was a great army commander.
He was a brave soldier, but he had
a problem. He had a terrible skin
disease calledleprosy
.

---

One day, Naaman’s wife said,
“My servant told me you should go see
the prophet Elisha. He can heal you.”

---

Naaman reached Elisha’s home.
Elisha sent out a man with this message:
“Dunk yourself in the Jordan River
seven times. Then you will be healed.”

---

At first, Naaman thought it was a silly
idea. But his servants said, “Please go.
This is not a hard thing to do.”
So Naaman dunked himself in the
Jordan River seven times. When he was
done, Naaman’s skin disease was gone!

---

Naaman was so excited that he ran
to thank Elisha for curing him.
Naaman said, “Israel’s God
is theonly
true God!”
