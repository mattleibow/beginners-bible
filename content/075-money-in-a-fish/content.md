title: Money in a Fish
bible: Matthew 17:24–27
---

It was time to pay the temple tax.
This money was used to fix up the temple.

---

One day, some tax collectors said to Peter,
“Jesus does not pay the temple tax, does
he?” Peter replied, “Of course he does.”

---

Before Peter could ask Jesus what to do,
Jesus told him, “Even though I am the
Son of God, I will pay the tax. Go fishing.
Take the first fish you catch. Look in its
mouth and you will find a coin.
Take it and give it to the tax collectors.
It will pay my tax and yours.”

---

Peter caught a fish. He opened its
mouth and found a coin inside!
It was exactly enough to pay
the tax collectors.
