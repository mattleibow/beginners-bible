title: Elisha’s Room
bible: 2 Kings 4:8–17
---

Elisha often traveled to the town
of Shunem. He became friends
with a nice couple who lived there.

---

One evening, while Elisha was
visiting, the couple surprised him.
They said, “We built a room in our
house just for you.”

---

Elisha was so thankful for his friends.
He prayed for them to be happy.
Elisha said to the woman,
“A year from now you will have a child.”

---

Sure enough, a year later God
gave them a beautiful baby boy.
