title: The Battle of Jericho
bible: Joshua 6
---

After the spies were safely home,
God told Joshua,
“March your army around Jericho
with thepriests
blowing their horns.
Do this once a day for six days.

---

“On the seventh day, have your army
march around the city seven times.”
Joshua did exactly as God said.

---

The priests blew their trumpets.
The soldiers shouted as loud as they could.
Then the great walls of Jericho
came tumbling down!

---

The Israelite army rushed in
and took over the city.
The spies kept their promise to Rahab.
Her whole family was saved!
