title: Earthquake in Prison
bible: Acts 16:24–34
---

Some people did not like Paul and his
friend Silas preaching about Jesus.
One day, they were thrown into prison.
But they were not worried. They knew
God would take care of them.

---

That night, God sent an earthquake.
It shook so hard that all the prison doors
opened up and all the prisoners’
chains fell off. The guard thought
everyone had escaped. He was terrified!

---

Paul told the guard, “Do not worry.
We are still here.” The guard was amazed.
He invited the two men to his house.

---

The guard and his family learned
about Jesus and decided to follow him.
The next day, Paul and Silas left
to tell more people about Jesus.
