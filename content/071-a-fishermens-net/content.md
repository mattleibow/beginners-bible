title: A Fishermen’s Net
bible: Matthew 13:47–49
---

Jesus told a story. “One day,” he said,
“some fishermen took their boat out.”

---

“They threw their net into the water.
All kinds of fish swam in the lake.”

---

“When the fishermen returned to shore,
they dragged their net out of the water
and looked through their catch,” said Jesus.

---

“They kept all the good fish and tossed
out all the bad fish.” Jesus said, “The
fishermen’s net is like God’s kingdom.”

---

“Everyone wants to be part of his kingdom.
But the angels will come and separate the
godly people from the ungodly people.”

---

“The godly people will live in heaven
with me forever.”
